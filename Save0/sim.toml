[hay]
seconds_to_10m = 41.48

# Optimized approach:
# - 32 drones (one per column), always moving North (wrap-around)
# - harvest() + move(North) loop, no can_harvest() check
# - Grass regrows automatically, yields 512 hay/harvest

# Approaches tested that didn't help:
# - Batch sizes (2,3,4,5,8): all ~41.4-41.6s
# - Random seeds (0-9): all identical at 41.48s
# - can_harvest() check: 41.68s (overhead)
# - Plant grass explicitly: 61.6s (extra 200 ticks)
# - Smaller grid (16x16): 81.39s (less grass to harvest)
# - Zigzag patterns: 51.84s (extra movement)
# - Double harvest per cell: 61.6s (wasted ticks on empty)
# - Double move per harvest: 61.6s (skip cells)
# - 2 drones per column (16 cols): 81.89s (less coverage)
# - Staggered starting positions: 41.97s (positioning overhead)
# - Fertilizer: 122.05s (use_item overhead)
# - Water: 41.48s (no effect on grass)
# - Single drone: >120s (no parallelism)
# - Stationary harvesting: very slow (waiting for regrowth)

# Fundamental limits:
# - Grass regrows in 0.47s, yields 512 hay/harvest
# - harvest() = 200 ticks, move() = 100 ticks (with Power)
# - 32 drones max, tick rate ~6075 ticks/sec
# - Column pass (32 cells) = 9600 ticks = 1.58s
# - Each cell harvested 1x per 1.58s (vs 0.47s regrowth)
# - Bottleneck: drone speed, not grass regrowth

[wood]
seconds_to_10m = 7.94

# Optimized approach:
# - Two-phase: plant first, then harvest
# - Phase 1: All drones plant checkerboard pattern (Tree on even x+y, Bush on odd)
# - Wait for planters to finish
# - Phase 2: Spawn harvesters while moving West
# - Checkerboard avoids adjacent tree slowdown

# Yield per harvest:
# - Tree: 409,600 wood (!)
# - Bush: 512 wood
# - Only ~25 tree harvests needed for 10M

# Tested approaches:
# - All trees (no checkerboard): 26.64s - WORSE (adjacent trees slow each other)
# - Single-phase plant+harvest: 8.08s
# - Two-phase, spawn harvesters moving East: 8.03s
# - Two-phase, spawn harvesters moving West: 7.94s (BEST)

# Optimizations applied:
# - Power (2x movement speed, move = 100 ticks vs 200)
# - 32 drones (one per column)
# - Wrap-around (always North, no direction changes)
# - No can_harvest() check (harvest anyway, saves 1 tick)
# - Spawn while moving (reduces worker East moves)

[carrot]
seconds_to_10m = 17.73

# Optimized approach (POLYCULTURE):
# - Checkerboard pattern: carrots on (x+y)%2==0, trees on odd
# - Trees act as companions giving 160x yield bonus
# - 512 carrot cells * huge bonus = massive yield per cycle
# - Water carrots during replant

# Polyculture discovery:
# - get_companion() returns (type, (x,y)) for bonus
# - Base yield: 512 carrots/harvest
# - With companion: 81,920 carrots/harvest (160x!)
# - Checkerboard trees satisfy many companion requirements

# Previous best (no polyculture):
# - Water if < 0.3: 72.04s
# - No water: 140.93s
# - Water always: 89.88s

# Optimizations applied:
# - Polyculture checkerboard (carrots + trees)
# - 32 drones parallel planting/harvesting
# - Water on replant
