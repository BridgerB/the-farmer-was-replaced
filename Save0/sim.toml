[hay]
seconds_to_10m = 41.48

# Optimized approach:
# - 32 drones (one per column), always moving North (wrap-around)
# - harvest() + move(North) loop, no can_harvest() check
# - Grass regrows automatically, yields 512 hay/harvest

# Approaches tested that didn't help:
# - Batch sizes (2,3,4,5,8): all ~41.4-41.6s
# - Random seeds (0-9): all identical at 41.48s
# - can_harvest() check: 41.68s (overhead)
# - Plant grass explicitly: 61.6s (extra 200 ticks)
# - Smaller grid (16x16): 81.39s (less grass to harvest)
# - Zigzag patterns: 51.84s (extra movement)
# - Double harvest per cell: 61.6s (wasted ticks on empty)
# - Double move per harvest: 61.6s (skip cells)
# - 2 drones per column (16 cols): 81.89s (less coverage)
# - Staggered starting positions: 41.97s (positioning overhead)
# - Fertilizer: 122.05s (use_item overhead)
# - Water: 41.48s (no effect on grass)
# - Single drone: >120s (no parallelism)
# - Stationary harvesting: very slow (waiting for regrowth)

# Fundamental limits:
# - Grass regrows in 0.47s, yields 512 hay/harvest
# - harvest() = 200 ticks, move() = 100 ticks (with Power)
# - 32 drones max, tick rate ~6075 ticks/sec
# - Column pass (32 cells) = 9600 ticks = 1.58s
# - Each cell harvested 1x per 1.58s (vs 0.47s regrowth)
# - Bottleneck: drone speed, not grass regrowth

[wood]
seconds_to_10m = 7.94

# Optimized approach:
# - Two-phase: plant first, then harvest
# - Phase 1: All drones plant checkerboard pattern (Tree on even x+y, Bush on odd)
# - Wait for planters to finish
# - Phase 2: Spawn harvesters while moving West
# - Checkerboard avoids adjacent tree slowdown

# Yield per harvest:
# - Tree: 409,600 wood (!)
# - Bush: 512 wood
# - Only ~25 tree harvests needed for 10M

# Tested approaches:
# - All trees (no checkerboard): 26.64s - WORSE (adjacent trees slow each other)
# - Single-phase plant+harvest: 8.08s
# - Two-phase, spawn harvesters moving East: 8.03s
# - Two-phase, spawn harvesters moving West: 7.94s (BEST)

# Optimizations applied:
# - Power (2x movement speed, move = 100 ticks vs 200)
# - 32 drones (one per column)
# - Wrap-around (always North, no direction changes)
# - No can_harvest() check (harvest anyway, saves 1 tick)
# - Spawn while moving (reduces worker East moves)

[carrot]
seconds_to_10m = 9.56

# Optimized approach (POLYCULTURE):
# - Checkerboard pattern: carrots on (x+y)%2==0, bushes on odd
# - Bushes act as companions giving partial polyculture bonus
# - Continuous harvest loop (no repositioning between cycles)
# - Water during initial plant phase

# Polyculture discovery:
# - get_companion() returns (type, (x,y)) for bonus
# - Base yield: 512 carrots/harvest
# - With companion: 81,920 carrots/harvest (160x!)
# - Each carrot wants SPECIFIC companion type at SPECIFIC position
# - Checkerboard pattern satisfies SOME companion requirements

# Phase breakdown (9.56s total):
# - Plant phase: 5.23s (till + water + plant carrots, plant bushes)
# - Wait for growth: 0s (carrots ready when plant phase ends)
# - Harvest phase: 3.29s (continuous loop until 10M)

# Tested companion types:
# - Bushes: 9.56s (BEST)
# - Trees: 17.73s (grow slower, runs out of resources)
# - Grass only: runs out of resources (not enough bonus)
# - Mixed (bush+tree+grass): runs out of resources

# Approaches tested that didn't beat 9.56s:
# - No water in plant phase: runs out of resources
# - Water in harvest phase instead: 12.89s
# - Alternating columns (not checkerboard): 13.66s
# - Skip modulo check, harvest all cells: 10.96s (can't plant on grassland)
# - Exact companion placement: 25s+ (movement overhead too high)
# - Plant carrots first, then bushes: runs out of resources
# - Combined plant+harvest function: runs out of resources
# - Spawn while moving West: 6.25s plant phase (worse)

# Previous best (no polyculture):
# - Water if < 0.3: 72.04s
# - No water: 140.93s

# Fundamental limits:
# - Plant phase bottleneck: 700 ticks per carrot cell (till+water+plant+move)
# - 512 carrot cells / 32 drones = 16 cells per drone
# - Theoretical minimum: 16 * 700 / 6075 = 1.84s per drone
# - Actual: 5.23s (spawn overhead, movement between columns)
# - To hit <5s total, need plant phase <2s - not achievable with current approach

[pumpkin]
seconds_to_10m = 167.22

# BASELINE - needs optimization
# - Grid: 32x32 = 1024 cells
# - Plant phase: 6.29s (parallel drones)
# - Wait/replant: 159.83s (4 rounds)
# - Yield: 3,145,728 (only ~146³ connected, NOT full mega pumpkin)

# Pumpkin mechanics:
# - Growth time: ~2 seconds
# - Cost: 1 carrot per pumpkin
# - ~20% death rate → Dead_Pumpkin, needs replanting
# - Adjacent grown pumpkins merge into "mega pumpkin"
# - Yield = (connected pumpkins)³
# - If all 1024 connected: 1,073,741,824 pumpkins (1 billion!)
# - Must wait for ALL ready before harvesting ANY

# Current issue:
# - Mega pumpkin is fragmented (only ~146 connected)
# - Dead pumpkins break connectivity
# - Wait/replant phase too slow, more die while checking
