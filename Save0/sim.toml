[hay]
seconds_to_10m = 41.48

# Optimized approach:
# - 32 drones (one per column), always moving North (wrap-around)
# - harvest() + move(North) loop, no can_harvest() check
# - Grass regrows automatically, yields 512 hay/harvest

# Approaches tested that didn't help:
# - Batch sizes (2,3,4,5,8): all ~41.4-41.6s
# - Random seeds (0-9): all identical at 41.48s
# - can_harvest() check: 41.68s (overhead)
# - Plant grass explicitly: 61.6s (extra 200 ticks)
# - Smaller grid (16x16): 81.39s (less grass to harvest)
# - Zigzag patterns: 51.84s (extra movement)
# - Double harvest per cell: 61.6s (wasted ticks on empty)
# - Double move per harvest: 61.6s (skip cells)
# - 2 drones per column (16 cols): 81.89s (less coverage)
# - Staggered starting positions: 41.97s (positioning overhead)
# - Fertilizer: 122.05s (use_item overhead)
# - Water: 41.48s (no effect on grass)
# - Single drone: >120s (no parallelism)
# - Stationary harvesting: very slow (waiting for regrowth)

# Fundamental limits:
# - Grass regrows in 0.47s, yields 512 hay/harvest
# - harvest() = 200 ticks, move() = 100 ticks (with Power)
# - 32 drones max, tick rate ~6075 ticks/sec
# - Column pass (32 cells) = 9600 ticks = 1.58s
# - Each cell harvested 1x per 1.58s (vs 0.47s regrowth)
# - Bottleneck: drone speed, not grass regrowth

[wood]
seconds_to_10m = 7.94

# Optimized approach:
# - Two-phase: plant first, then harvest
# - Phase 1: All drones plant checkerboard pattern (Tree on even x+y, Bush on odd)
# - Wait for planters to finish
# - Phase 2: Spawn harvesters while moving West
# - Checkerboard avoids adjacent tree slowdown

# Yield per harvest:
# - Tree: 409,600 wood (!)
# - Bush: 512 wood
# - Only ~25 tree harvests needed for 10M

# Tested approaches:
# - All trees (no checkerboard): 26.64s - WORSE (adjacent trees slow each other)
# - Single-phase plant+harvest: 8.08s
# - Two-phase, spawn harvesters moving East: 8.03s
# - Two-phase, spawn harvesters moving West: 7.94s (BEST)

# Optimizations applied:
# - Power (2x movement speed, move = 100 ticks vs 200)
# - 32 drones (one per column)
# - Wrap-around (always North, no direction changes)
# - No can_harvest() check (harvest anyway, saves 1 tick)
# - Spawn while moving (reduces worker East moves)

[carrot]
seconds_to_10m = 9.56

# Optimized approach (POLYCULTURE):
# - Checkerboard pattern: carrots on (x+y)%2==0, bushes on odd
# - Bushes act as companions giving partial polyculture bonus
# - Continuous harvest loop (no repositioning between cycles)
# - Water during initial plant phase

# Polyculture discovery:
# - get_companion() returns (type, (x,y)) for bonus
# - Base yield: 512 carrots/harvest
# - With companion: 81,920 carrots/harvest (160x!)
# - Each carrot wants SPECIFIC companion type at SPECIFIC position
# - Checkerboard pattern satisfies SOME companion requirements

# Phase breakdown (9.56s total):
# - Plant phase: 5.23s (till + water + plant carrots, plant bushes)
# - Wait for growth: 0s (carrots ready when plant phase ends)
# - Harvest phase: 3.29s (continuous loop until 10M)

# Tested companion types:
# - Bushes: 9.56s (BEST)
# - Trees: 17.73s (grow slower, runs out of resources)
# - Grass only: runs out of resources (not enough bonus)
# - Mixed (bush+tree+grass): runs out of resources

# Approaches tested that didn't beat 9.56s:
# - No water in plant phase: runs out of resources
# - Water in harvest phase instead: 12.89s
# - Alternating columns (not checkerboard): 13.66s
# - Skip modulo check, harvest all cells: 10.96s (can't plant on grassland)
# - Exact companion placement: 25s+ (movement overhead too high)
# - Plant carrots first, then bushes: runs out of resources
# - Combined plant+harvest function: runs out of resources
# - Spawn while moving West: 6.25s plant phase (worse)

# Previous best (no polyculture):
# - Water if < 0.3: 72.04s
# - No water: 140.93s

# Fundamental limits:
# - Plant phase bottleneck: 700 ticks per carrot cell (till+water+plant+move)
# - 512 carrot cells / 32 drones = 16 cells per drone
# - Theoretical minimum: 16 * 700 / 6075 = 1.84s per drone
# - Actual: 5.23s (spawn overhead, movement between columns)
# - To hit <5s total, need plant phase <2s - not achievable with current approach

[pumpkin]
seconds_to_10m = 90.69

# Optimized approach (ALTERNATING FAST-REPLANT):
# - Plant pass going East
# - Fast replant pass going West (no waiting, just scan/replant dead)
# - Fast replant pass going East
# - Wait+replant pass going West (wait for each pumpkin to be ready)
# - Move to center, harvest
# - Repeat until 10M
# - 6 harvests, ~15s per cycle, ~3.1M per harvest

# Pumpkin mechanics:
# - Growth time: ~2 seconds
# - Cost: 1 carrot per pumpkin
# - ~20% death rate → Dead_Pumpkin, needs replanting
# - Adjacent grown pumpkins merge into "mega pumpkin"
# - Yield = (connected pumpkins)³
# - Replanted pumpkins form SEPARATE clusters (don't merge with original)

# Key discovery:
# - Full mega pumpkin (1024³ = 1B) is NOT achievable
# - Dead pumpkins break connectivity permanently
# - Replants grow at different times → separate clusters
# - Best strategy: accept fragmentation, do multiple harvests

# Key optimization:
# - Alternating East/West spawning eliminates return-to-origin between passes
# - Fast replant passes (no waiting) are quicker than wait+replant
# - 2 fast replants + 1 wait gives optimal cluster connectivity

# Tested approaches:
# - Single mega harvest attempt: 167.22s (baseline, fragmented)
# - Multi-harvest from corner (0,0): 116.74s
# - Multi-harvest from center: 114.06s
# - 2 wait passes + center: 109s
# - Alternating 2 fast-replant + 1 wait: 90.69s (BEST)
# - Bidirectional spawning: 114.89s
# - 4 passes (1 plant + 3 replant + 1 wait): 134.01s
# - 16 drones (2 cols each): 176.7s (less parallelism)
# - 16x16 grid: 167.69s (smaller clusters)
# - Fertilizer: 93.15s (runs out of fertilizer)
# - Multi-harvest points: 119.71s (movement overhead)
# - No replanting: 198.81s (clusters too small)
# - Minimal (plant + wait only): 176.8s

[cactus]
seconds_to_10m = 93.13

# Optimized approach (24x24 GRID):
# - Use 24x24 grid instead of 32x32 (fewer cells = faster sorting)
# - Plant all cacti with parallel drones
# - Wait for all to grow (~1 second)
# - Sort rows in parallel (each drone bubble-sorts its row)
# - Sort columns in parallel (each drone bubble-sorts its column)
# - Harvest from (0,0) - triggers full chain
# - Single harvest yields 10.6M cactus (>10M target)

# Cactus mechanics:
# - Growth time: ~1 second
# - Cost: 64 pumpkins per cactus (!!)
# - Each cactus has size 0-9 (random)
# - measure() returns size
# - Harvesting triggers chain: adjacent cacti in sorted order also harvest
# - Yield = (chain length)² * 32
# - 24x24 grid sorted = 576² * 32 = 10,616,832 per harvest

# Key discovery:
# - Smaller grid = faster sorting but lower yield
# - 24x24 is optimal: just enough yield (10.6M) for single harvest
# - 23x23 yields only 8.95M (needs 2 cycles = slower)
# - 32x32 yields 33.5M but sorting takes too long

# Phase breakdown (93.13s total):
# - Plant: 3.76s
# - Wait: 3.01s
# - Row sort: 43.18s
# - Col sort: 41.16s
# - Harvest: ~2s

# Tested approaches:
# - 32x32 full sort: 158.38s
# - 32x32 with 15 passes: 94.29s (11.3M yield)
# - 32x32 with 16 passes: 98.26s (13M yield)
# - 25x25 full sort: 97.9s
# - 24x24 full sort: 93.13s (BEST)
# - 23x23 full sort: 83.2s but only 8.95M (needs 2 cycles)
# - 16x16 full sort: 205.36s (5 cycles needed)
# - 8x8 full sort: 846s (77 cycles needed)

[bone]
seconds_to_10m = 723

# Optimized approach (24x24 HAMILTONIAN CYCLE):
# - 24x24 grid with Hamiltonian cycle path (visits all 576 cells)
# - Snake follows fixed cycle, NEVER traps itself
# - Collect 560 apples in single cycle (minimum for 10M)
# - Pre-computed direction array for each cycle position
# - 560² × 32 = 10,035,200 bones in ONE cycle

# Bone mechanics:
# - Equip Dinosaur_Hat to start snake mini-game
# - Apples spawn randomly, eating grows tail by 1
# - Bones = (apples_eaten)² × 32 per cycle
# - Move speed: 400 ticks base, -3% per apple eaten (gets FASTER!)
# - With Power: 200 ticks base (2x speed)
# - After 200 apples: ~0.5 ticks per move!

# Hamiltonian cycle construction (24x24):
# - Column 0: all rows 0-23 (going North)
# - Columns 1-23: rows 1-23 only (skip row 0), alternating up/down
# - Row 0 return: (23,0) -> (22,0) -> ... -> (1,0)
# - Cycle closes: (1,0) adjacent to (0,0)

# Key discoveries:
# - 24x24 is minimum grid for 10M in single cycle (576 cells, need 562+)
# - Single large cycle >> multiple small cycles (bone formula is quadratic)
# - Pre-computing directions saves ~77s (800s -> 723s)
# - Greedy chase traps at 20-50 apples; Hamiltonian gets 574

# Minimum apples calculation:
# - Need 10M bones = apples² × 32
# - apples = sqrt(10M / 32) = 559.02 → need 560 apples
# - Grid needs 560 + 2 cells = 562 minimum
# - 23x23 = 529 (NOT ENOUGH), 24x24 = 576 (works!)

# Phase breakdown (723s total):
# - Setup: ~1s (go_home, change_hat)
# - Chase: ~722s (560 apples, 60712 moves)
# - Early moves: ~200 ticks each
# - Late moves: ~few ticks each (speed bonus stacks!)

# Grid size comparison:
# - 16x16: 1230s (5 cycles of 254 apples each)
# - 20x20: 1006s (2 cycles of 398 apples)
# - 24x24: 723s (1 cycle of 560 apples) - BEST
# - 32x32: 2234s (too many moves despite single cycle)

# Tested approaches:
# - Greedy chase (any size): 20-50 apples/cycle, traps itself
# - 16x16 Hamiltonian: 1230s (5 cycles needed)
# - 24x24 Hamiltonian: 800s (baseline)
# - 24x24 + pre-computed dirs: 723s (BEST)
# - 24x24 + shortcuts (jump to apple): blocked (unsafe)
# - 32x32 Hamiltonian: 2234s (too many moves)
